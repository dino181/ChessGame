Installing react:
move to directory with 
```
cd .../<directory>   (just moving directories)
cd /d D:/<directory> (moving between drives)

dir (lists folders/files in the current directory)
```` 
Once in the folder you may need to run (should be checked)
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

To run the application move to the my_app folder and start the react app using the following commands
```
cd my_app
npm start
```
